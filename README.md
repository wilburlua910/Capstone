This repository contains the source code, training scripts, and contents that is used to build, deploy the Capstone Project and the Conference papers.

# Capstone Project Title
### Real-Time Covid-19 Face mask detection: Edge Intelligence with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Single Shot Detectors

# Conference (Accepted into 5th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, PRAI, IEEE Xplore)
### Deep Learning in IoT and Edge Computing for Safety Applications - PRAI 



## Motivation
- Current "Traditional" detectors (E.g. VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-50) have high amounts of trainable parameters leading to high computations, memory and power consumption (CPU, GPU, Network). 
- Contribute to Public Health and Safety applications by researching, experimenting and deploying an FMD system that can be deployed on the Edge (NVIDIA Jetson Nano)
- Edge Intelligence, bring Deep Learning onto Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

Methodology

1. Trained model using YOLOv5 with custom dataset
2. Trained model using SSD-MobileNet (EfficientNet)
